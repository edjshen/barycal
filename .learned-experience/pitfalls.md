# Pitfalls — Next.js on Cloudflare + 2026 library traps

## 2026-06-25 — discovered during Orbit stack review

**Deprecated / beta libs to avoid (verified):**
- **`next-pwa`** (shadowwalker) last published 2022 = abandoned; `@ducanh2912/next-pwa` (2024) stale (same author moved to Serwist). → use **`@serwist/next`**.
- **Auth.js v5 / NextAuth** still `5.0.0-beta.x` after ~3 years, with documented workerd friction (jose incompat, `AUTH_SECRET`/`AUTH_TRUST_HOST` surface). On Cloudflare Workers prefer **iron-session** unless you actually need OAuth. → revisit Auth.js/Better Auth only when social login is real.
- **Lucia auth** = **sunset** as a library (now a learning resource). Don't recommend it.
- **`framer-motion`** is NOT dead — it's a maintained **frozen alias** of `motion` (both at v12.41.0, published same second 2026-06-23). For new work import `motion/react`.

**Runtime gotchas:**
- **No native `bcrypt` on Workers** — use a Web-Crypto/WASM hasher (`@noble/hashes` scrypt/argon2).
- **OpenNext ↔ Next upgrades:** gate every Next minor bump on adapter support (Next 16.2.0 crashed on Workers, OpenNext issue #1157). First-class CF adapter (on Next 16.2 stable Adapters API) expected ~end of 2026.
- **Keep the Worker bundle < 3 MiB gz** to stay on Workers Free.
- **Serwist `sw.js` on Cloudflare/OpenNext:** `/public` (incl. `sw.js`) is served by Workers Static Assets and **bypasses the worker**, so `next.config` `headers` won't apply. Add `sw.js` to `run_worker_first` in the OpenNext config to control its cache headers. Registration/scope still work.

**React 19 / Next 16 gotchas:**
- **`useOptimistic` only auto-rolls-back if the Server Action THROWS.** If an action returns an error object instead of throwing, the optimistic state sticks. Make mutations throw on failure.

**Vendor coupling:**
- **Cloudflare D1's low overhead only holds when hosting on Workers.** If hosting ever flips to Vercel, D1 is the wrong DB (binding-only fast path; admin REST throttles ~4 req/s) → switch to **Neon** (HTTP driver) with Drizzle. Rule of thumb: **host=Cloudflare→D1, host=Vercel→Neon.**
- **Supabase free tier auto-pauses after 7 days idle** (needs a keep-alive cron or $25/mo Pro) — a reason it lost to D1 for a low-touch single-vendor setup.

## 2026-06-26 — barycal first prod deploy (Next.js 16 + OpenNext + CF Workers/D1)
- **`custom_domains` is NOT a valid wrangler.jsonc key** (silently ignored). Use `"routes":[{"pattern":"x.com","custom_domain":true}]`. This is why barycal.com never provisioned despite the config block.
- **Apex DNS:** the Worker Custom Domain binding auto-creates the *www* record, but the *apex* (barycal.com) record did NOT get created via the wrangler OAuth token (can't edit zone DNS). www + workers.dev served fine; apex needs the CF dashboard (or self-provisions later). Zone NS confirmed on CF.
- **`workers.dev` gets disabled** by a plain `wrangler deploy` when routes exist but `"workers_dev": true` is absent. Add it to keep the *.workers.dev fallback URL.
- **SQLITE_BUSY at build:** running `wrangler d1 ...` concurrently with `next build`/`build:cf` (miniflare opens the local SQLite/DO) → fatal `SQLITE_BUSY`. Never run wrangler DB cmds while building.
- **Playwright + Next 16 forms:** hidden `$ACTION_REF_*` Server Action inputs mean `form input` nth(0) grabs the hidden one. Target `input[type="text"]`/by-name/by-type.
- **Minor:** prod app emits React hydration mismatch (#418) — non-fatal, recovers; likely SSR-vs-client date render. Follow-up fix.
